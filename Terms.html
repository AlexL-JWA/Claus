                                <p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your computer depends on whether such cookie is a session or permanent cookie.</p>
                                <p><i>Session cookie</i></p>
                                <p>Session cookie is usually stored as a session ID during the user’s browsing session and is not personally identifiable. Session cookies are never written on the hard drive. When user completes the session and closes the browser, these cookies are automatically deleted from the user’s computer. Session cookies expire at the end of the user's browser session and can also become no longer accessible after the session has been inactive for a specified length of time, usually 20 minutes.</p>

                                <p>The protection of your personal privacy is vital to us. EasyWork has developed and implemented its Privacy Policy which principles meet the requirements of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (“Data Protection Directive”).</p>
                                <p>Providing personal data is an act of trust and it is taken seriously. Unless given consent to do otherwise and/or otherwise permissible by and/or required by law, EasyWork will only collect and use personal data as set out below. </p>
                                <p>Throughout this Privacy Policy, we refer to your “personal data”, which means information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, that is, information about a person whose identity is either manifestly clear or can at least be established by obtaining additional information.</p>
                                <h2 class="title">MODIFICATIONS TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
                                <p>We may in our absolute discretion modify, update and revise this Privacy Policy at any time without notice. Any modifications will be effective upon posting unless otherwise stated. We may post any changes to this Privacy Policy on our Website or notify you by email.

                                <h2 class="title">INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THIRD PARTIES</h2>
                                <p>In some circumstances we may receive information about you from parties other than you or EasyWork. This information can be received by us when we collect outside records from third party and/or third party websites.

                                <h2 class="title">PASSIVE INFORMATION COLLECTION</h2>
                                <p>As with many websites, we may also collect analytical information whenever you access or interact with the Website. Such information collected by us or third party content providers may include browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to the Website, the search terms you entered into a search engine that led you to the Website, areas within the Website that you visited, and other information commonly shared when browsers communicate with websites. We may also collect information about the location, date, time and duration of visits and which pages of a Website are most commonly accessed. </p>
                                <p>This information is generally not linked to the identity of visitors, except where a Website is accessed via links in an email we have sent or where we are able to uniquely identify the device or User accessing a Website. We use this information to improve our Services to you, to improve marketing, analytics, and site functionality.</p>
                                <p>As you navigate through our Website, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as Unique Device Identifiers (UDI), cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream). Your Internet browser automatically transmits to the Website you are browsing some of this anonymous information or personal data, such as the URL of the website you just came from, the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the UDI (if applicable) and the browser version your device is currently using. Our Website may also collect anonymous information or personal data from your device through cookies and Internet tags or web beacons. You may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of the Website might not work without cookies and this may limit the Services provided by the Website. Cookies and other technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorised by us to collect information on our behalf. We and our service providers may also employ software technology known as an Embedded Script. An Embedded Script is programming code that is embedded into applications to collect information about a User’s interactions with the Website, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device and is deactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Website.</p>
                                <p>For more information about cookies and other technologies, please refer to our Cookie Policy.</p>
                                <p>Our Website may use and combine such passively collected anonymous information or personal data from various third party sources, to provide better Service to Website visitors and Users, customise the Website based on your preferences, compile and analyse statistics and trends, and otherwise administer and improve the Website for your use. By accessing the Website, you consent to information about you being collected, compiled and used in this way.</p>
                                <h2 class="title">WORK DIARIES AND WORK VIEW</h2>
                                <p>When a freelancer works for a client’s project, we may record information on work status and work intervals through a relevant application downloaded by the User. As such, while a freelancer is working on a client’s project, we automatically collect information about a number of mouse clicks made by the freelancer and we may record screenshots. This information is gathered when a freelancer is working with the use of the application.</p>
                                <p>Such information will be used and shared with the relevant client. The freelancer may choose to delete screenshots and work data. However, it will disable the freelancer to receive the payment for deleted work intervals. </p>
                                <p>EasyWork will use this information for analytical, statistical research and marketing purposes as well as for product development.</p>
